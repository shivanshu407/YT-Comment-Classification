# **YouTube Comments Sentiment Analysis**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes YouTube comments using machine learning models to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify and gain insights from user interactions on videos.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack & Libraries**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` – Data preprocessing
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine learning model training
  - `NLTK` – Text preprocessing and sentiment analysis
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization

## 🚀 **Project Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YouTube-Sentiment-Analysis.git
   cd YouTube-Sentiment-Analysis
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 **Dataset**
- The dataset consists of YouTube comments scraped from various videos.
- Each comment is labeled as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** based on its sentiment.
- You can use public datasets or scrape YouTube comments using `youtube-comment-downloader`.

## 🔍 **How It Works**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removing special characters, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.
   - Tokenization and Lemmatization using NLTK.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Converting text to numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Training ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
   - Evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🏆 **Results & Insights**
- The model achieves **X% accuracy** on test data.
- Most frequent words in positive/negative comments are visualized using **word clouds**.
- The best-performing model is **[model name]**, with an accuracy of **X%**.

## 📜 **Usage**
- **Run the sentiment analysis on a dataset**
  ```bash
  python sentiment_analysis.py --input data/comments.csv
  ```
- **Train a new model**
  ```bash
  python train_model.py --model logistic_regression
  ```

## 🛠 **Future Improvements**
- Implement **Deep Learning** models (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.
- Add **Multilingual Support** for analyzing comments in different languages.
- Improve data collection using **real-time YouTube API**.
